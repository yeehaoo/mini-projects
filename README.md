Recreational projects that don't deserve their own repository

Maple Bot: AutoHotKey script for MapleStory (abandoned project)

RSSim: RuneScape Simulator
Started this project because I find that RS has many areas in which I can emulate, and learn Tkinter and Python at the same time. Also, I used to spend a lot of time on RS.
